# Sort Names in File

This Python script sorts the names in a `.dat` file in alphabetical order and writes the sorted names back to the file.

## Usage

To use the script, simply run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
python sort_names_in_file.py
```

The script will prompt you to enter the file path to the `.dat` file you want to sort. Once you enter the file path and press Enter, the script will sort the names in the file and write the sorted names back to the file.

## Function Description

The main function in the script is `sort_names_in_file(file_path)`, which takes the file path as an argument.

Here's a breakdown of what the function does:

1. Opens the file in read mode and reads all the lines into a list.
2. Sorts the names in the list in alphabetical order.
3. Opens the file in write mode and writes the sorted names back to the file, separated by newlines.
4. Prints a success message to indicate that the names have been sorted and written back to the file.

The function also includes error handling for the following cases:

- `FileNotFoundError`: If the specified file is not found, the function prints an error message.
- `Exception`: If any other exception occurs, the function prints an error message with the exception details.

## Example

Suppose you have a `.dat` file named `names.dat` with the following contents:

```
John
Jane
Bob
Alice
```

Running the script with the file path `names.dat` will sort the names in alphabetical order and write the sorted names back to the file:

```
Alice
Bob
Jane
John
```

## Dependencies

This script does not have any external dependencies and can be run using a standard Python installation.
